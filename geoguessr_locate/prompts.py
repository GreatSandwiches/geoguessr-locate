Task: Analyze the attached image and provide a primary guess and top-<<TOP_K_MINUS_1>> alternative candidates.

Definitions:
- Rough area = country, primary admin area (state/province/region), nearest major city.
- Also include an estimated lat/lon and confidence radius (km). Confidence is 0..1.
- Use ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 for country_code when possible.

Instructions:
- Be extremely thorough in your analysis. Examine every visible detail in the image.
- Cross-reference multiple visual cues to validate your conclusions.
- If OCR text from signage is provided below, incorporate it carefully as additional evidence.
- Enforce internal consistency:
  * Ensure the latitude/longitude fall within the predicted country and region.
  * Ensure driving side and speed units (mph vs km/h) match the predicted country.
  * If a contradiction is detected, revise the guess to a consistent alternative.
  * When a specific named POI, road number, or junction name is visible, anchor the guess to that precise feature and reduce the confidence radius accordingly.
- Optional OCR text (may be empty):
  <<OCR_TEXT>>
- Provide precise confidence scores:
  * 0.9-1.0: Multiple strong identifiers confirming exact location
  * 0.7-0.9: Clear regional markers with specific city/area confidence
  * 0.5-0.7: Good country/region confidence but location uncertainty
  * 0.3-0.5: Conflicting cues or limited identifiable markers
  * 0.0-0.3: High uncertainty or insufficient data
- Confidence radius should directly correlate with certainty:
  * 1-5km: Precise location identified
  * 5-20km: General urban area known
  * 20-50km: Regional area identified
  * 50-200km: Broader region only
  * 200km+: Country-level confidence only
- For road identification:
  * Analyze line colors, patterns, and widths
  * Note shoulder types and marking styles
  * Check for regional-specific traffic signs
  * Identify unique intersection layouts
- For architecture and infrastructure:
  * Document distinctive building materials
  * Note power line configurations
  * Identify regional-specific street furniture
  * Record unique architectural patterns
- Return strictly valid JSON. No extra keys. No markdown or explanations.

Additional OpenAI-specific instructions:
- Think briefly but DO NOT output the chain-of-thought; only output the JSON object.
- If you are not at least 70% confident in precise coordinates within 50km, set latitude and longitude to null and provide a realistic confidence_radius_km instead.
- If confidence_radius_km > 150, also set latitude and longitude to null.
- Do not invent non-existent road numbers or place names.
